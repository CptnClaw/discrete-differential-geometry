# ddg-exercises

C++ assignment skeleton for course on [Discrete Differential Geometry](http://geometry.cs.cmu.edu/ddg) (15-458/858)

For the JavaScript version, see <https://github.com/cmu-geometry/ddg-exercises-js>

This code framework builds on [GeometryCentral](http://geometry-central.net/) and [Polyscope](http://polyscope.run/).  Extensive documentation for these libraries---_and how to build them on various platforms_---can be found at the preceding links.  If you're having trouble building, please make sure to take a look before bugging the TAs! :-)  (We are of course still very happy to help if you're still having trouble.)
